\subsection{The evolution of earnings inequality and the minimum wage\label{appendix: inequality and mw}}

Figure \ref{fig:var_minw} shows a strong negative comovement between the minimum wage and the
standard deviation of log wages between 1985 and 2018, with a time series correlation of $-0.947$.

\subsection{The (relatively small) spike at the minimum wage \label{app:mw_spike}}

Much of the previous empirical literature has interpreted the mass of workers employed at the minimum wage as a measure of the bindingness of the wage floor \citepappendix{Flinn2006_appendix,Flinn2010_appendix}. However, theoretical labor market models in the spirit of \citetappendix{BurdettMortensen1998_appendix} predict that frictional wage dispersion for identical workers can be sustained absent any mass points in the wage distribution, including at the minimum wage. This suggests that any spike of workers at the minimum wage may be thought of independently from, or maybe in addition to, the effect of the minimum wage on the rest of the wage distribution. Although there is substantial heterogeneity in the empirical bindingness of the minimum wage across population subgroups in our administrative data from Brazil, we robustly find a relatively small spike at the wage floor for male workers of age 18--54. The remainder of this subsection is dedicated to studying the (relatively small) spike at the minimum wage in Brazil, both in the cross section and over time.


\paragraph{Share of workers earning exactly, below, or around the minimum wage.}

Panel \subref{subfig: share-at-MW-A} of Figure \ref{fig: share-at-MW}
plots the state-level distribution of the share of workers
earning exactly the minimum wage against the relative
bindingness of the minimum wage measured by the Kaitz-50 index, defined
as the log minimum-to-median wage, in 1996 and 2018. The average share of workers earning exactly the minimum wage is stable around two percent throughout this period.%
%
\footnote{For comparison, 3.3 percent of hourly paid workers in the U.S. earned the prevailing federal minimum wage or less in 2015 \citepappendix{BureauofLaborSt2016_appendix}.} %
%
We find a weak positive correlation between the Kaitz-50 index and the
share of workers earning the minimum wage, but the share remains
mostly below six percent even in states where the minimum wage is
most binding.

We can broaden our definition of a ``mass point'' to three alternative measures, the evolution of which from 1996 to 2018 is depicted in panel \subref{subfig: share-at-MW-B}
of Figure \ref{fig: share-at-MW}. The share of workers earning exactly
the minimum wage, shown by the blue line with circles, remains approximately flat at two percent between 1996 and 2018.
A little under 3.5 percent of workers in 1996 and around 5.5 percent of workers in 2018 report earning exactly or less than the minimum wage,
shown by the red line with diamonds.%
%
\footnote{Observations with earnings strictly below the minimum wage are likely due to a mix
of legal exceptions, misreporting, and illegal employment.} %
%
Our most generous definition includes workers within a 5 percent band around
the minimum wage, shown in green. This most generous measure evolves
from 3.5 to 5.5 percent over this period, far from the roughly 30 percent
of workers between the old and the new minimum wage.

\subsection{Who earns the minimum wage in Brazil?\label{appendix:who_earns_the_mw}}

Figure \ref{fig: MW_share_current_by_edu} shows the share of workers currently earning the minimum wage by education group. The share of minimum wage earners is higher at younger ages and lower educational attainments. Yet the maximum share of minimum wage earners, namely that of workers of age 18--24 with at most a primary school degree, is around four percent.

A striking feature of the Brazilian labor market is that, in spite of a relatively small share of workers earning the minimum wage at any point in time, a surprisingly large share of workers ever---currently, in the past, or in the future---earn the minimum wage. Figure \ref{fig:MW_share_ever} plots the share of workers who have ever earned the minimum wage during our sample period of 1996--2018.

\subsection{Additional results on the effects of the minimum wage on wage inequality\label{app_subsection:lee_regressions}}

We now show that the inverse relationship between state-year level bindingness of the minimum wage and wage inequality generalizes to the full set of states over time. To see this, we define the \emph{Kaitz-50 index} as $kaitz_{st}(50) \equiv \log w_{t}^{min} - \log w_{st}(50)$, that is, the log difference between the minimum wage prevailing at time $t$, $w_{t}^{min}$, and the median wage of subgroup $s$ at time $t$, $w_{st}(50)$.%
%
\footnote{Recall that Figure \ref{fig: kaitz} in Appendix \ref{subsec:kaitz-evolution} shows that variation in the Kaitz-50 index and the Kaitz-90 index across Brazilian states is large initially and decreases as the minimum wage increases, while approximately preserving the ranking of states over time.} %
%
Figure \ref{fig:Lee_data} plots the relation between different
log wage percentile ratios and the Kaitz-50 index. Panel \subref{fig:Lee_data_subfig A} plots empirical lower-tail
inequality, measured by the P50/P10, against the Kaitz-50 index across
Brazilian states over time. The negative 45 degree line marks states
where the minimum wage is binding at the tenth percentile of the wage distribution.
Panel \subref{fig:Lee_data_subfig B} repeats the same exercise
for the P50/P25 ratio. Both plots show a negative relationship lower-tail inequality and the Kaitz-50 index that grows more pronounced for more binding states in the cross section and over time. For comparison, the remaining two panels
show a weaker relationship between top inequality, measured by the
P75/P50 in panel \subref{fig:Lee_data_subfig C} and by the P90/P50 in panel \subref{fig:Lee_data_subfig D}, and the Kaitz-50 index.%

\subsection{Additional regression results: Alternative specifications\label{app_subsec_alt_specs}}

Figure \ref{app_fig_alt_specs} compares our baseline results (black line with circles) with three alternative specifications that consist of an IV specification in levels (blue line with diamonds), an OLS specification in differences (red line with triangles), and an IV specification in differences (green line with squares). For all specifications, relative to P50, percentiles above the median and reaching up as high as the 90th percentile remain statistically significant. Relative to P90, spillover effects are present up to at least the 70th wage percentile. Notably, the IV specification in levels closely matches our baseline results, which were estimated via OLS in levels.

Therefore, our main conclusions regarding the reach of spillovers remain unchanged under alternative specifications.

Each panel shows the results from four different specifications (colored markers and lines, plus error bars or shaded areas).

Within each panel, the estimated marginal effect of the minimum wage on the standard deviation of log earnings (``St.d.'' on the x-axis) and on wages between the 10th and the 90th percentiles of the wage distribution (``10'' to ``90'' on the x-axis) relative to some base wage $p$ are shown. Panel \subref{app_fig_alt_specs_A} uses the 50th percentile as the base wage (i.e., $p=50$), while panel \subref{app_fig_alt_specs_B} uses the 90th percentile as the base wage (i.e., $p=90$). The four error bars and four shaded areas represent 99 percent confidence intervals based on regular (i.e., not clustered) standard errors. %

\subsection{Additional regression results: Alternative controls\label{app_subsec_alt_controls}}

Figure \ref{app_fig_alt_specs} compares our baseline results (black line with circles) with four specifications using alternative sets of controls, namely only state fixed effects (blue line with diamonds), only year fixed effects (red line with triangles), state fixed effects and year fixed effects (green line with squares), and a final specification with state fixed effects, year fixed effects, and state-specific linear time trends (orange line with plus signs). For all specifications, relative to P50, percentiles above the median and reaching up as high as the 90th percentile remain statistically significant. Relative to P90, spillover effects are consistently present up to the 90th wage percentile.

Therefore, our main conclusions regarding the reach of spillovers remain unchanged under alternative sets of controls.

\subsection{Additional regression results: Alternative time periods\label{app_subsec_alt_periods}}

Figure \ref{app_fig_alt_specs} compares our baseline results (black line with circles) with three specifications using alternative time periods, namely the high-inflation period of 1985--1995 (blue line with diamonds), a period from 1985--12007 that is equally long as but earlier than our baseline period (red line with triangles), and the period of all available years from 1985--2018 (green line with squares). For all specifications, relative to P50, percentiles above the median and reaching up as high as the 90th percentile remain statistically significant. Relative to P90, all but the early high-inflation period from 1985--1995 show spillover effects that are consistently present up to the 90th wage percentile. Results for the early high-inflation period are measured more noisily and are significant only below the 60th percentile of wages.

Therefore, our main conclusions regarding the reach of spillovers remain unchanged under alternative time periods and, furthermore, Brazil early high-inflation period does not exhibit significantly stronger spillovers than the later period we study.

\subsection{Additional regression results: Polynomial orders for state-specific trends\label{app_subsec:lee_regressions_trends}}

There has been a fruitful debate concerning the potential benefits and harms from including region-specific time trends in econometric studies of the minimum wage---see for example \citetappendix{NeumarkSalasWascher2014_appendix}, \citetappendix{AllegrettoDubeReichZipperer2017_appendix}, and \citetappendix{NeumarkWascher2017_appendix}. To demonstrate the robustness of our findings to the concerns raised by this debate, Figure \ref{app_fig_alt_trends} shows additional specifications based on the econometric methodology in Section \ref{subsec:Spillover-effects-identified}. Specifically, we vary the polynomial degree order for state-specific time trends between one and three (with the degree-zero specifiction being that with only state fixed effects presented in Appendix \ref{app_fig_alt_controls}). Figure \ref{app_fig_alt_trends} presents the results from these alternative specifications.

Starting with a description of Figure \ref{app_fig_alt_trends}, we note that specifications with either a quadratic or cubic trend show similar patterns to one another in terms of estimated marginal effects, particularly in the lower tail of the wage distribution. The estimated patterns are also similar to our baseline specification with state-specific linear time trends. All three specifications deliver significant effects of the minimum wage above the median, when measured relative to P50, and up to the 90th percentile of wages, when measured relative to P90.%
%
\footnote{While our finding of far-reaching spillover effects of the minimum wage are robust to the choice of state-specific time trends, we note that including state-specific higher-order time trends in this specification may possibly be asking for too much from our comparably short state-year panel of 23 years. For this reason, we prefer the specification with state fixed effects and only state-specific linear time trends as our baseline.} %
%

Therefore, our main conclusions regarding the reach of spillovers remain unchanged under alternative polynomial orders for state-specific time trends.

\subsection{Additional regression results: Clustering standard errors\label{app_subsec:lee_regressions_cluster}}

Figure \ref{app_fig_alt_ses} shows additional specifications based on the econometric methodology in Section \ref{subsec:Spillover-effects-identified} of the main text. Specifically, although the number of clusters at the state level falls below common thresholds for clustering \citepappendix{CameronMiller2015_appendix}, we here cluster standard errors at the state level. In contrast, Section \ref{subsec:Spillover-effects-identified} shows results based on unadjusted standard errors. The main take-away from Figure \ref{app_fig_alt_ses} is that standard errors become somewhat larger under clustering of standard errors at the state level, though they become smaller again when estimating our specification and clustering standard errors at the mesoregion level. Therefore, our main conclusions regarding the reach of spillovers remain unchanged under alternative ways of clustering standard errors.

\subsection{Comparison with \citet{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}\label{app_subsec:lee_regressions_haanwinckel}}

In complementary work, \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} follows our approach of estimating spillover effects of the minimum wage in Brazil using a methodology based on the seminal framework by \citetappendix{Lee1999_appendix} and the more recent contribution by \citetappendix{Autor2016_appendix}. Using a subset of 14 years of the RAIS data from 1996--2001, 2005--2009, and 2011--2013, \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} reports significant spillover effects of the minimum wage up to the 40th wage percentile with a 95 percent confidence interval, and up to the 30th wage percentile with a 99 percent confidence interval. The standard error bands estimated by \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} are relatively large above the median, rendering the point estimates indistinguishable from zero. In contrast, our baseline results using the 1996--2018 data indicates spillovers that are significant up to at least the 75th percentile of the wage distribution.

There are several notable differences between our empirical approach and that in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}. We discuss two key differences here. One difference is the exact econometric specification, which in the case of \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} includes a national quadratic time trend in addition to the state fixed effects and state-specific linear trends that we include in our baseline specification. We show below, by including a national quadratic trend, that this difference in specifications does not systematically change our insights, though some error bands increase significantly. A second difference is the set of years on which these specifications are estimated. We show below, by estimating our specification as well as those including a national quadratic trend, that this difference does explain some of the discrepancy in findings between our work and that by \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}. Furthermore, estimating our baseline specification and those with national quadratic trends on the full sample of 34 years of the RAIS data from 1985--2018, we robustly find significant spillovers up to at least the 75th wage percentile with comparably narrow standard error bands.

To establish these results, we proceed in two steps. First, we reestimate our baseline specification for different sets of years to investigate their sensitivity to the choice of time period. Second, we implement the specifications from \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} on our baseline period (1996--2018) and compare the results to those from the same specification using either the restricted set of years used in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} (1996--2001, 2005--2009, and 2011--2013), or the full set of years in the RAIS data (1985--2018).


\paragraph{Alternative results using baseline specification estimated on different time periods.}

We reestimate our baseline specification with state fixed effects and state-specific linear trends on three sets of years of the RAIS data, namely our baseline period comprising 1996--2018 (black line with circles), the years used in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} comprising 1996--2001, 2005--2009, and 2011--2013 (blue line with diamonds), and the full period comprising 1985--2018 (red line with triangles). To remain conservative and also to match the choice in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}, we cluster standard errors at the state level.

Figure \ref{app_fig_haanwinckel_state_trend_1_ols_levels} shows the resulting estimates of these three specifications. Several points are worth noting. First, our baseline estimates remain significant up to the 90th percentile, both relative to P50 and also relative to P90. Second, the point estimates based on the subset of years used in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} are close to ours in the lower tail, and slightly less pronounced in the upper tail, relative to P50. They are uniformly below ours, relative to P90. Third, a the same time, standard errors are significantly higher when using a subset of years, particularly in the upper tail. This results in point estimates above the 70th percentile being insignificant based on the years used in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}, while they remain significant in our baseline. Fourth, using additional years going back to 1985 leads to similar point estimates and standard error bands compared to our baseline estimates.

From this, we conclude that---starting from our baseline specification---the choice of years matters somewhat for the estimated reach of spillovers, though the estimated effects remain significant up to the 70th percentile of wages.




\paragraph{Alternative results using specifications from \citet{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} estimated on different time periods.}

Next, we estimate specifications that include the same set of controls as in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}: state fixed effects, state-specific linear trends, and a national quadratic trend. We first estimate these specifications via OLS in levels. As above, we estimate the specification on three different time periods, namely our baseline period comprising 1996--2018 (black line with circles), the years used in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} comprising 1996--2001, 2005--2009, and 2011--2013 (blue line with diamonds), and the full period comprising 1985--2018 (red line with triangles). As above, we cluster standard errors at the state level.

The results are presented in Figure \ref{app_fig_haanwinckel_state_trend_1_ntrend_2_ols_levels}. There are a couple of take-aways. First, the inclusion of a national quadratic trends slightly attenuates the point estimates and significantly increases the standard error bands. Second, using our baseline years continues to yield significant effects of the minimum wage up to the median and again at the 60th wage percentile, relative to P50. All estimated effects remain significant up to the 90th wage percentile, relative to P90. Third, the subset of years used in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} yield point estimates that are substantially similar to our baseline but not statistically significant above the 35th wage percentile, relative to P50. Point estimates are somewhat attenuated and remain significant up to the 65th wage percentile, relative to P90. Finally, using the full set of years yields point estimates that lie within the standard error bands of the other two sets of estimates but themselves have significantly tighter error bands.

Next, we estimate specifications that include state fixed effects, state-specific linear trends, and a national quadratic trend via IV in levels. %
Figure \ref{app_fig_haanwinckel_state_trend_1_ntrend_2_iv_levels} shows the results. Both the estimates for our baseline set of years and that used in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} yield estimates that are significant up to the 30th wage percentile but not above, due to very wide standard error bands, relative to P50. Relative to P90, the error bands are even wider. Both of these results suggest that the inclusion of a quadratic national trend is leaving little variation over and above that induced by the instrumented Kaitz-$p$ indices over the period from 1996 to 2018. In contrast, the specification based on the full set of years continues to show significant effects of the minimum wage up to the 90th percentile.

Next, we estimate specifications that include state fixed effects, state-specific linear trends, and a national quadratic trend via OLS in differences. %
Figure \ref{app_fig_haanwinckel_state_trend_1_ntrend_2_ols_diff} shows the results. Qualitatively, the results are similar to the OLS specification in levels above. All specifications show some significant effects above the median and up to the 85th percentile, relative to P50. At the same time, the standard error bands are relatively wider for the specification using only the subset of years in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}. This becomes particularly evident when looking at the results relative to P90, which have error bands large enough to render some of the lower---but not the higher---wage percentiles insignificant. As above, the specification estimated on the full set of years remains significant throughout most of the wage distribution.

Finally, we estimate specifications that include state fixed effects, state-specific linear trends, and a national quadratic trend via IV in differences. %
Figure \ref{app_fig_haanwinckel_state_trend_1_ntrend_2_iv_diff} shows the results. Qualitatively, the results are similar to the previous specification using OLS in differences. One notable difference is that, while our baseline estimates remain significant throughout most of the wage distribution, both relative to P50 and relative to P90, the estimates using the years in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} are all significant up to the 85th wage percentile using our baseline set of years, but significant only up to the 15th wage percentile using the subset of years in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}.

From this, we conclude that our results are largely robust to the set of specfications used in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}, although for some specifications the standard error bands associated with the inclusion of quadratic national trends for the time period starting in 1996 leads to strikingly wide error bands. It is worth noting that our results are similarly pronounced and tightly estimated when using the full set of years from 1985 to 2018. In contrast, the results using the subset of years from \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} tend to deliver more noisy estimates, leading point estimates to turn insignificant lower in the wage distribution than would otherwise be the case.



\paragraph{Summary.}

From the above analysis, we conclude that the results presented in the main text are robust to alternative specifications, including those presented in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}.

Considering additional years of data between 1996 and 2018 (and, separately, between 1985 and 2018) allows us to exploit significantly more variation in the effective bindingness of the federal minimum wage---see Appendix \ref{app_subsec:comparison_Brazil_US}---which leads us to find minimum wage spillovers that robustly reach up to at least the 75th wage percentile. This finding is reassuring given that our structural model, as well as the alternative structural model developed by \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}, predict spillover effects throughout most of the wage distribution.

To conclude, we note that there are other important differences between our work and the complementary analysis contained in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}, over and above the exact specification and choice of years. For example, \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix} uses the population of men and women between the ages of 18 and 54, while the analysis of the current paper \citepappendix{EngbomMoser2022_appendix} and that in \citetappendix{EngbomMoser2018_appendix} is restricted to only men. These differences likely explain the remaining divergence between our results and those presented in \citetappendix{Haanwinckel2020_appendix}.

\subsection{Comparison of wages in nominal terms and in multiples of the minimum wage\label{app_subsec:comparison_nominal_multiples}}

In this subsection, we compare the distributions of (changes in) wages across two numeraires: current BRL and the current minimum wage. We demonstrate that while the minimum wage does share certain attributes of a numeraire \citepappendix{NeriMoura2006_appendix}, it does so imperfectly. Consequently, it is not purely mechanical that wages throughout the wage distribution are affected by the minimum wage, as documented in Section \ref{subsec:Spillover-effects-identified}.

To see why the distinction between the two numeraires matters, consider the following example. Suppose worker A gets paid 2.0 times the minimum wage throughout their employment spell that lasts from January to June of a given calendar year. Suppose worker B also gets paid 2.0 times the minimum wage but their employment spell lasts from January to December. Now suppose that the statutory minimum wage stands at BRL 400 from January to June, then increases to BRL 500 from July to December. Then the two workers' wages are the same in multiples of the current minimum wage (i.e., both receive constant pay equal to 2.0 times the current minimum wage) but differ in terms of nominal BRL (i.e., worker A has a mean wage of BRL 400 that consists of a constant stream, while worker B has a mean wage of BRL 450 that changes levels over time). Therefore, the numeraire matters for our measure of wage dispersion within and across individuals.

We begin our analysis with the variable in RAIS that contains each job's mean wage in multiples of the current minimum wage in each year, which is the one underlying our entire analysis in the main text. To obtain a wage measure in nominal BRL, we multiply the mean wage in multiples of the current minimum wage by the months-of-employment-weighted mean of the minimum wage prevailing during that year, using each job's start and end months. Our measurement likely contains some noise because both wages and the minimum wage itself can change over time within a job spell.

Comparing log wages in current BRL and multiples of the current minimum wage, we note that only 2.4 percent of all workers have a constant wage in terms of multiples of the current minimum wage between two consecutive years. For comparison, that number is 0.2 percent in nominal terms. That the latter number is smaller than the former suggests that the minimum wage does serve some numeraire function. At the same time, both shares are small, highlighting the importance of idiosyncratic wage changes.

Figure \ref{fig:nominal_vs_multiples} shows histograms of (changes in) wages in each of the two numeraires. Panel \subref{subfig:nominal_vs_multiples_A} shows that the distribution of log wages has a relatively more pronounced spike in multiples of the current minimum wage, which is our baseline wage measure. The distribution of one-year changes in log wages in panel \subref{subfig:nominal_vs_multiples_B} shows less dispersion in multiples of the minimum wage, particularly in the right tail. However, both distributions are significantly dispersed, indicating that by both wage measures are far from fixed at a constant multiple of the numeraire.

That is, each panel shows the distribution of earnings in log current BRL (blue bars), calculated as the logarithm of the mean multiples of the current minimum wage recorded during each calendar year multiplied by the mean minimum wage prevailing during the months of employment during that year, and the log mean multiples of the current minimum wage (red bars).

Another way to assess the minimum wage's numeraire function is a simple variance decomposition, where we write the variance of some outcome variable of interest, $y_{it}$, across individuals $i$ and years $t$ as
%
\begin{align}
  Var(y_{it}) = \underbrace{Var(\mathbb{E}[y_{it} | i])}_{\text{Variance of individual-level means}} + \underbrace{Var(y_{it} - \mathbb{E}[y_{it} | i])}_{\text{Variance of dispersion around individual-level means}}. \label{eq:numeraire_var_decomposition}
\end{align}
%
Here, the outcome variable $y_{it}$ can be either log wages or the one-year changes in log wages. Table \ref{tab:comparison_nominal_vs_multiples} shows the results from the variance decomposition in equation \eqref{eq:numeraire_var_decomposition} for different population subgroups (all workers, only stayers in the same occupation, only stayers at the same employer), for log wages versus one-year changes in log wages, and for the two numeraires: current BRL and the current minimum wage. Starting with wage levels in panel A, the total variance of log wages is slightly higher in current BRL than in multiples of the current minimum wage, 88.8 log points compared to 75.0 log points. Around 25 percent of the total variance is attributable to the variance of dispersion around individual-level means when measured in current BRL, compared to 12 percent when measured in multiples of the current minimum wage. This suggests that the minimum wage partially serves as a numeraire for wages in the economy. Turning now to one-year changes in log wages, we see that, at the same time, there is substantial dispersion in wages from one year to the next, regardless of the numeraire, with variances of 25.1 log points in current BRL and 17.9 log points in multiples of the current minimum wage. A similar share of the total variance of one-year changes in log wages is due to the variance of dispersion around individual-level means, around 73 percent in current BRL compared to 70 percent in multiples of the current minimum wage. This tells us that earnings are not fixed, not even in terms of multiples of the current minimum wage. Finally, Panels B and C show the same variance decompositions for workers who remain in the same occuapation (panel B) or at the same employer (panel C) between years, leading us to draw broadly similar conclusions.

We conclude that, while the minimum wage does share certain attributes of a numeraire \citepappendix{NeriMoura2006_appendix}, it does so imperfectly. Thus, our empirical results in Section \ref{subsec:Spillover-effects-identified} are unlikely to be driven solely by this phenomenon.

\subsection{Hours distribution and its relation to the bindingness of the minimum wage\label{sec:Hours}}

Most adult males in Brazil's formal sector work in a full-time contract,
defined as either 40 work hours (spread across 5 days) or 44 work
hours (spread across 6 days) per week. Figure \ref{fig: hours} shows
the raw distribution of hours for this population for 1996 in panel \subref{subfig: hours-A}, and for 2018 in panel \subref{subfig: hours-B}.
In the initial period, around 74 percent of all workers work 44 hours
per week and another 15 percent work 40 hours per week, constituting
around 89 percent of workers in full-time employment. Only arounnd
five percent of all employees are in employment arrangements with
less than 35 contractual work hours per week.\footnote{According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics a higher share, around
12 percent of employees, works part-time (less than 35 hours) in the
US in 2017.} Furthermore, the comparison between panels \subref{subfig: hours-A}
and \subref{subfig: hours-B} show that there is no evidence over
time---as the minimum wage increases---of a shift towards shorter
work weeks in the aggregate. In contrast, there was a small reduction
in the share of workers with 30 hour contracts that in the aggregate
shifted toward 44 hour contracts.

Going beyond the aggregate statistics, there is also little systematic
covariation between the relative bindingness of the minimum wage and
work hours across Brazilian states. Figure \ref{fig: hours-kaitz}
shows that both the share of full-time employment in panel \subref{subfig: hours-kaitz-A}
and the mean number of hours in panel \subref{subfig: hours-kaitz-B}
stay constant as the minimum wage increases between 1996 and 2018.
While in 1996 there is a weak systematic negative relationship between
the full-time worker share and the bindngnes of the minimum wage,
measured by the Kaitz-50 index, this appears almost entirely driven by
transitory fluctuations and permanent state-specific heterogeneity,
rather than a correlation with the rising minimum wage over time within
states.
